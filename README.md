# Multi-Signature Wallet DApp
A MultiSig wallet is a digital wallet that operates with multisignature addresses. This means that it requires more than one private key to sign and authorize a crypto transaction.

A decentralised multisignature crypto digital wallet helps users to create multiple wallets and add multiple owners. It even enables the user to deposit and withdraw ETH, and multiple other ERC20 token in the wallet and lets user to send a transaction that needs to be approved by other owners of the wallet.

Smart Contract is deployed on the Ethereum Sepolia Network.

# Features

* The contract supports ETh & 2 test tokens; DAI, LINK
* User can create new wallets and Add or Remove Owners to the wallet
* User can deposit and withdraw Eth and tokens in wallet.
* Usage of **Factory Contract**: A factory contract deploy a new smart contract from a smart contract class. In this way, it can deploy multiple smart contracts with different parameters directly from the blockchain itself
* Integration with web3 wallets (Metamask)
* Interacting with any contracts with UI support
* User can create a transaction which will deposit Eth or ERC20 tokens in the receivers account.
* **Multisig Wallet n-of-m**: Transactions require some of the keys, but not necessarily all of them, to be authorized (1-of-2, 2-of-3, 3-of-5 etc.).
